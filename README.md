<p align="center"><em>Because AirDrop was never supposed to work on Intel Wi-Fi.</em></p>

**AirDrop for Intel Wi-Fi cards on macOS.** ForbiddenItlwm is a fork of AirportItlwm that adds AWDL, the peer-to-peer Wi-Fi link AirDrop runs on. Apple's own Wi-Fi stack does the rest. Normal Wi-Fi stays connected while AirDrop works.

> **Public beta. Newest release: [0.5.3-test1](https://github.com/retropineaple/ForbiddenItlwm/releases/latest).** Works on macOS Tahoe 26.7.x and Sequoia 15.8.x, with a Sonoma 14.8.9 test build. Each macOS version has its own kexts. Fixes come out often: before reporting a problem, update to the newest release (**Watch → Custom → Releases** to be notified).

## ⚠️ Read this first

> [!WARNING]
> **Use it at your own risk.** ForbiddenItlwm is experimental beta software that runs inside the macOS kernel. A bug can cause kernel panics, bootloops, lost Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, failed transfers, or a hackintosh that won't boot from that EFI. It comes with no warranty of any kind, and I am not liable for any damage or data loss.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project was built with the use of AI.** Most of the driver code, the reverse-engineering and the test tools were written with the help of AI (Claude). I am not a professional kernel developer. I closely monitored and directed the work, researched and reviewed it, and ran every hardware test on my own hardware, but AI written code can still contain mistakes that testing on a few machines won't catch. If you'd rather not run AI-assisted kernel code, please don't install it.

- Test from a USB stick with a copy of your EFI, never your only working one.
- Run the [compatibility checker](#will-it-work-on-my-hackintosh) first.
- **Before you update macOS, boot once without `-btleadv`.** Otherwise an incremental update can fail.

## What works

On the project's test machine (AX211, macOS 26.7.1, iPhone 11), with normal 5 GHz Wi-Fi connected the whole time:

| | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Mac → iPhone | Works. About 22 MB/s, connects in 1 to 4 s |
| iPhone → Mac | Works. About 20 MB/s, a cold connect usually takes 3 to 10 s |
| Handoff, Universal Clipboard | Work |
| iMessage and push over Wi-Fi | Work |

Speed depends on the iPhone's own Wi-Fi: full speed when it's off Wi-Fi or on channel 149, less when it's busy on another channel. Users with other machines report similar results; see [where it was tested](docs/TESTED-HARDWARE.md).

## Supported macOS and cards

| macOS | Builds | AirDrop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tahoe | 26.7.1, 26.7.2, 26.7.3 | Works (tested on 26.7.1, users on 26.7.2 and 26.7.3) |
| Sequoia | 15.8, 15.8.1, 15.8.2, 15.8.3 | Works from 0.5.1-test1 (users on 15.8.1 to 15.8.3) |
| Sonoma | 14.8.9 | Test build, not yet run on hardware |

On any other build the driver keeps AirDrop off and works as plain Wi-Fi. [docs/TESTED-HARDWARE.md](docs/TESTED-HARDWARE.md) has every build and report.

**Cards:** Intel cards AirportItlwm supports. The project tests the AX211; users report the AX201, AX210, AX200 and an AX1690i working.

**No OCLP Wi-Fi patches.** ForbiddenItlwm needs macOS's own Wi-Fi stack. If you used OpenCore Legacy Patcher's "Modern Wireless" root patch for an older AirportItlwm, revert it, and also remove what it added to `config.plist` (see [INSTALL](docs/INSTALL.md#before-you-start)). Left in place, they stop Wi-Fi from starting.

## Will it work on my hackintosh?

```bash
bash tools/compat/check_compat.sh
```

Read-only: it changes nothing and sends nothing anywhere. More in [tools/compat](tools/compat/README.md).

**Channel 149 and your country.** AirDrop is fast on channel 149 at 80 MHz, the channel Apple devices use for it.
- **The card has to learn your country first,** from a nearby Wi-Fi network that advertises it (most routers do; an iPhone's Personal Hotspot switched on nearby also works). Until then it falls back to channel 6.
- **Some countries don't allow channel 149** (Japan, Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, for example), or only at 20 or 40 MHz. AirDrop then uses channel 6, which works but is slow.
- **In China and other places where the card marks 149 as passive,** AirDrop moves to 149 once it has heard a Wi-Fi network there, as Linux does.
- **Coming:** in countries without 149, iPhones use **channel 44** instead. We're working on using 44 at 80 MHz there before falling back to 6 ([#17](https://github.com/retropineaple/ForbiddenItlwm/issues/17)).

The checker shows your country and whether channel 149 is open; [TROUBLESHOOTING](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#the-listener-is-on-channel-6-or-countrylearned-is-no) explains the rest.

## Install

See **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**. In short: on a USB stick with a copy of your EFI, replace `AirportItlwm.kext` with the `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` for your macOS, add `BTLEAdvFixup.kext`, add the [boot flags](docs/BOOT-FLAGS.md), and boot from the stick. Don't load AirportItlwm and ForbiddenItlwm together.

## After installing: what to test

Boot from the USB stick, join your Wi-Fi network, wait a minute, then check:

1. **The driver runs:** `bash tools/compat/check_compat.sh` shows the AirDrop build running and your card and Bluetooth as OK.
2. **Wi-Fi works:** browse, and try a speed test.
3. **Bluetooth works:** it's on, and `ioreg -l -w0 -d1 | grep '"BTLEAdvHookRouted'` shows 1.
4. **AirDrop's channel:** `ioreg -l -w0 | grep '"ITLAWDLCoexChannel"'` shows 149 (6 means slow; see above).
5. **AirDrop both ways:** send a large file from the Mac to the iPhone, and one from the iPhone to the Mac. Run `bash tools/compat/airdrop_measure.sh` while you do, to see the speed and connect time.
6. **iMessage:** send and receive an iMessage on the Mac. If it fails, `printf 'show State:/Network/Interface/en0/LinkQuality\n' | scutil` should show 100 (or 50 or 10 on a weak signal); see [TROUBLESHOOTING](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#imessage-or-other-apple-services-dont-work-over-wi-fi).

Please report what you find, working or not, in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/retropineaple/ForbiddenItlwm/issues), with your card, macOS build and the checker's output.

## Known limitations

- **Mac → iPhone can be much slower than iPhone → Mac** on some setups ([#22](https://github.com/retropineaple/ForbiddenItlwm/issues/22), [#24](https://github.com/retropineaple/ForbiddenItlwm/issues/24)). Under investigation.
- **Connects can be slow,** mostly iPhone → Mac.
- **Normal Wi-Fi loses some speed while AirDrop's listener runs** (they share the radio).
- **A long list of boot flags,** sleep untested, iPhone only (iPads and Macs not tried).

What's planned: [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md).
