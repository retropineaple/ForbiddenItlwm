# Installing ForbiddenItlwm

This beta has been tested on one hackintosh: an HP Envy x360 13-bf with an Intel AX211, on macOS 26.7.1 (25G241), booted with OpenCore 1.0.8, with an iPhone 11. Users report it working on 26.7.2 (25G332) and 26.7.3 (25G342). The Sequoia build (15.8.x) was verified offline. Users report Wi-Fi working on it. AirDrop needs 0.5.1-test1 or later; users confirmed it working on 15.8.1, 15.8.2, 15.8.3 and 15.6. The Sonoma build (14.8.9, test build) was verified offline only. The details are in [TESTED-HARDWARE.md](TESTED-HARDWARE.md). Read the whole page before you start.

## Before you start

- **Check your macOS build:** `sw_vers -buildVersion`.
  - **Tahoe:** `25G241`, `25G332` or `25G342`. Use the Tahoe kexts.
  - **Sequoia:** `24H23` (15.8) and `24H241` (15.8.3) were checked offline, and `24H32` (15.8.1) and `24H232` (15.8.2) run those verified kernels. Use the Sequoia kexts. AirDrop transfers on Sequoia need 0.5.1-test1 or later.
  - **Sonoma (test build):** `23J631` (14.8.9) was checked offline. Use the Sonoma kexts. On other Sonoma 14.4+ builds the Sonoma kext runs as plain Wi-Fi.
  - On any other build the driver keeps AirDrop off and works as plain Wi-Fi.
- **Use the kexts for your macOS version.** ForbiddenItlwm and BTLEAdvFixup are built separately for Tahoe, Sequoia and Sonoma. A ForbiddenItlwm built for the other version refuses to start, and BTLEAdvFixup's patterns won't match.
- **Revert OCLP Wi-Fi root patches.** ForbiddenItlwm uses the Wi-Fi stack that ships with macOS. If you applied OpenCore Legacy Patcher's "Modern Wireless" root patches for an older AirportItlwm, revert them first. Also remove what that setup added to config.plist: a `Kernel → Block` entry for `com.apple.iokit.IOSkywalkFamily`, and injected `IOSkywalkFamily.kext` or `IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext`.
- **Run the checker:** `bash tools/compat/check_compat.sh`. It tells you whether your card and Bluetooth are likely to work.
- **Use a USB stick.** Copy your working EFI folder to a USB stick and make every change there. Your internal EFI stays as it is, so if anything goes wrong you just boot without the stick.
- **Know the rollback:** boot from your internal EFI, or put the original `AirportItlwm.kext` and `config.plist` back on the stick.

## What you need

| Kext | Where from | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` | This repository, Tahoe, Sequoia or Sonoma build | Replaces `AirportItlwm.kext` |
| `BTLEAdvFixup.kext` | This repository, Tahoe, Sequoia or Sonoma build | Lets macOS start Bluetooth LE advertising on an Intel controller |
| `Lilu.kext` | [acidanthera/Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) | Tested with 1.7.2 |
| `IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext` | [OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware) | Tested with 2.5.1 |
| `BlueToolFixup.kext` | [acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) | Tested with 2.7.3 |

**Disable `IntelBTPatcher.kext`.** It and BTLEAdvFixup hook the same function, and Lilu panics if two plugins do. BTLEAdvFixup takes over IntelBTPatcher's job.

## Building

You need the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). Full Xcode isn't needed. The build was tested with Python 3 on the Intel hackintosh it was developed on.

1. Put MacKernelSDK in the repository folder. Commit `3f75008` is the one tested:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acidanthera/MacKernelSDK
   ```

2. Build the Wi-Fi driver for your macOS version. For Tahoe:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/build.py --out build
   ```

   For Sequoia:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/build.py --target sequoia --out build-sequoia
   ```

   For Sonoma:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/build.py --target sonoma --out build-sonoma
   ```

   The result is `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` in the output folder. The first build also generates `include/FwBinary.cpp` from the firmware in `itlwm/firmware`.

3. Build BTLEAdvFixup. It needs the Lilu SDK, which comes with Lilu's **DEBUG** release. Make a folder holding `MacKernelSDK` and the DEBUG `Lilu.kext`, then:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/build_btleadv.py --out build/btleadv --tree /path/to/that/folder
   ```

   For Sequoia, add `--target sequoia`, and for Sonoma `--target sonoma`, each with its own output folder. The result is `BTLEAdvFixup.kext` in the output folder.

4. Optional, for developers: run the offline tests and the ABI audit. The audit checks every virtual slot of the AWDL interface against its macOS version's own table. It must report 568 of 568 for Tahoe, 563 of 563 for Sequoia with `--target sequoia --build build-sequoia`, and 547 of 547 for Sonoma with `--target sonoma --build build-sonoma`:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/test_awdl.py
   ```

   ```bash
   python3 tools/abi/audit_vtable.py --lifecycle-overrides
   ```

## OpenCore setup

All of this goes on the **USB stick's** EFI.

1. **Kexts:** in `EFI/OC/Kexts`, remove `AirportItlwm.kext` and copy in `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` and `BTLEAdvFixup.kext`.

2. **`Kernel` → `Add`:** keep this order, so each kext comes after what it depends on.

   | Order | BundlePath | ExecutablePath | Notes |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | 1 | `Lilu.kext` | `Contents/MacOS/Lilu` | |
   | 2 | `IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext` | `Contents/MacOS/IntelBluetoothFirmware` | |
   | 3 | `BlueToolFixup.kext` | `Contents/MacOS/BlueToolFixup` | `MinKernel` 21.0.0 |
   | 4 | `BTLEAdvFixup.kext` | `Contents/MacOS/BTLEAdvFixup` | `MinKernel` 21.0.0 |
   | 5 | `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` | `Contents/MacOS/ForbiddenItlwm` | Replaces the old `AirportItlwm.kext` entry |

   **Recommended:** limit `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` and `BTLEAdvFixup.kext` to their macOS version with `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel`, so a stick moved to another macOS doesn't load the wrong build:

   | Build | `MinKernel` | `MaxKernel` |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Tahoe | 25.0.0 | 25.99.99 |
   | Sequoia | 24.0.0 | 24.99.99 |
   | Sonoma | 23.4.0 | 23.99.99 |

   Set `IntelBTPatcher.kext` to `Enabled` = false if you have it. This is required. Make sure no `AirportItlwm.kext` or `itlwm.kext` entry is still enabled.

3. **Boot arguments:** add the flags from [BOOT-FLAGS.md](BOOT-FLAGS.md) to `boot-args` under `NVRAM` → `Add` → `7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82`. Keep your existing arguments. Because OpenCore only writes NVRAM keys listed under `Delete`, check that `boot-args` is listed there for the same GUID.

4. **Validate:** `plutil -lint config.plist`, and `ocvalidate` if you have it.

## First boot

1. Boot from the USB stick.
2. Join your normal Wi-Fi network as usual.
3. Wait a minute, then check that the driver and its AirDrop listener are running. If Wi-Fi is off or greyed out, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#wi-fi-is-off-or-greyed-out-and-theres-no-en0).

   ```bash
   ioreg -l -w0 | grep -E '"ItlwmAWDL(InterfaceBuild|BuildCheck)"|"ITLAWDLCoex(Added|Channel|CountryLearned)"'
   ```

   You should see `forbidden-0.5.3-test1` (`forbidden-0.5.3-test1-sequoia` on Sequoia, `forbidden-0.5.3-test1-sonoma` on Sonoma), `BuildCheck` `verified`, `Added` Yes, `Channel` 149 and `CountryLearned` Yes. `Channel` 6 means the firmware hasn't opened channel 149: see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

4. Or run `bash tools/compat/check_compat.sh` again. It now also reads the listener's state.
5. Turn on AirDrop on both devices. Contacts Only works when the iPhone and the Mac share an Apple Account or know each other as contacts. Otherwise use Everyone for 10 Minutes.
6. Send a file each way.

## Before a macOS update

Boot once without `-btleadv` (or with BTLEAdvFixup disabled), then update. While BTLEAdvFixup is active, `bluetoothd`'s patched pages are what the system reads, and an incremental update that checks the file can fail. Then check that the new build is supported before turning `-btleadv` back on: see [the macOS builds](TESTED-HARDWARE.md#macos-builds).

## Uninstalling

On the stick (or your EFI, if you moved it there):
1. Remove `ForbiddenItlwm.kext` and `BTLEAdvFixup.kext`, and their `Kernel` → `Add` entries.
2. Put `AirportItlwm.kext` back.
3. Remove the `-itlawdl*`, `itlawdl*` and `-btleadv` boot flags.
4. Reboot.

The driver writes nothing to disk. BTLEAdvFixup patches `bluetoothd` in memory only.
